# Streaming Guide

This guide covers how to stream video from your PC to your iPhone using iOS-VCAM-Server.

## 📡 Method 1: WiFi Streaming (Easiest)

1.  **Connect Devices:** Ensure your PC and iPhone are on the **same WiFi network**. (5 GHz recommended).
2.  **Start Server:** Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1`.
3.  **Select Profile:** Choose **Option [A]** (Main Streaming) or select a profile like `srs_iphone_ultra_smooth_dynamic.conf`.
4.  **Get URL:** The launcher will display an RTMP URL, e.g., `rtmp://192.168.1.50:1935/live/srs`.
5.  **Configure Source:**
    *   **OBS Studio:** Set "Stream" > "Service" to Custom. Server: `rtmp://192.168.1.50:1935/live/`, Key: `srs`.
    *   **FFmpeg:** `ffmpeg -re -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -f flv rtmp://192.168.1.50:1935/live/srs`
6.  **Configure iPhone:**
    *   Open your VCAM app/tweak settings.
    *   Enter the RTMP URL or the HLS URL (`http://192.168.1.50:8080/live/srs.m3u8`).
    *   Start the "Camera" app. The video feed should appear.

## 🔌 Method 2: USB Streaming (Lowest Latency)

For professional or long-term use, USB is superior due to zero interference and high bandwidth.

### Option [U]: Automated USB Streaming (Recommended)

The launcher now includes **Option [U]** which automates the entire USB streaming setup:
1.  Connect iPhone via USB cable
2.  Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1` and choose **Option [U]**
3.  Enter SSH password when prompted (default: `alpine`)
4.  The launcher starts iProxy, Flask auth, SRS USB mode, and an SSH reverse tunnel
5.  Configure iPhone with URL: `rtmp://127.10.10.10:1935/live/srs`

This method uses SSH reverse tunneling and requires the special `.deb` package with IP `127.10.10.10`.

#### Audio status

The stable VCAM path is primarily a **virtual camera/video** path. OBS audio inside RTMP does not automatically become an iPhone microphone.

For explicit safe-audio experiments, enable AudioBridge in launcher configuration before Option [U]. When the PC bridge starts, the USB tunnel also exposes `127.10.10.10:1936` on the iPhone for the restricted `com.iosvcam.audiobridge.safe` target-app tweak. Safe AudioBridge 0.3.6 supports the normal rootless path and guarded RootHide `TweakInject` mirroring, but it is still a manually installed target-app package and not a global system Camera microphone replacement.

The previously built experimental package `com.iosvcam.audiobridge` is not safe to use on the tested Dopamine iOS 16.1.2 setup and should not be installed.

### Manual USB Setup (Alternative)

If Option [U] doesn't work for your setup, you can configure USB streaming manually:

#### Prerequisites
*   `libimobiledevice` (specifically `iproxy.exe`) installed on PC.
*   iPhone connected via USB.

#### Setup Steps
1.  **Port Forwarding:**
    Open a command prompt and run:
    ```cmd
    iproxy.exe 1935 1935
    ```
    *Open a second terminal for HTTP if needed:*
    ```cmd
    iproxy.exe 8080 8080
    ```

2.  **Server Config:**
    *   In the Launcher, select **Option [3]** -> `srs_usb_smooth_playback.conf`.
    *   **Crucial:** This config is tuned for ultra-low latency.

3.  **iPhone Config:**
    *   Set the URL in your tweak to `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/srs`.
    *   *Note:* The iPhone connects to *itself* (localhost), which `iproxy` forwards to your PC via USB.

### Advanced USB (Reverse SSH)
If standard `iproxy` is unstable, use Reverse SSH.
1.  **Tunnel:** `ssh -R 1935:localhost:1935 root@localhost -p 2222` (assuming port 22 is forwarded to 2222 via iproxy).
2.  See [Advanced Features](Advanced-Features.md) for detailed SSH tunneling.

## 🎥 Using OBS Studio

1.  **Output Settings:**
    *   **Encoder:** Hardware (NVENC/QSV) preferred.
    *   **Bitrate:** 2000 Kbps - 4000 Kbps (WiFi), up to 8000 Kbps (USB).
    *   **Keyframe Interval:** **1 second** (Important for low latency).
    *   **Profile:** baseline or main.
    *   **Tune:** zerolatency.
    *   **Audio:** AAC, 48 kHz, and ensure the streaming audio track includes the desktop/mic/media sources you expect.

2.  **Canvas:**
    *   Set Base/Output Resolution to match your iPhone's camera aspect ratio (usually 9:16, e.g., 1080x1920) if you are simulating a vertical camera.
